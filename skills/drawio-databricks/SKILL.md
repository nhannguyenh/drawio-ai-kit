description: Use when the user asks for a Databricks lakehouse architecture diagram — medallion architecture (Bronze/Silver/Gold), Delta Lake, Unity Catalog, workspace deployment, data-plane/control-plane, or any diagram built with Databricks icons. Builds with the declarative layout engine using ground-truth stencils, validates (stencils/colors/nesting/geometry), runs a render-based vision self-check. Default output is .drawio; PNG/SVG only on request.

# Draw.io Databricks

Produce correct Databricks lakehouse architecture diagrams in draw.io. This skill
is a thin frontend; the deterministic engine, validator, and rules live in the
`drawio-ai-kit` package, reached via the `drawio-ai` CLI.

## 0. Preflight — the CLI must be installed

```bash
command -v drawio-ai >/dev/null 2>&1 || echo "Install the Kit first:  npm i -g github:sparklabx/drawio-ai-kit"
```

If `drawio-ai` is **not** on PATH, stop and tell the user to run
`npm i -g github:sparklabx/drawio-ai-kit`. **Never run `npm i -g` yourself** — nothing mutates the
user's global environment without their say-so.

## 1. Shared Workflow

```bash
drawio-ai workflow
```

Prints the build → validate → render → write-to-project-path loop every diagram
follows. Read it; it is the source of truth for the process.

## 2. Domain rules

```bash
drawio-ai principles --mode databricks
```

Returns the Databricks rules + shared principles + catalog categories.

## 3. Build with the engine, then validate + render

Resolve the Kit's install dir, then `import` the engine by absolute path (the
Shared Workflow shows the exact pattern):

```bash
ROOT="$(drawio-ai root)"     # absolute path to the installed Kit
```

Build with the declarative layout engine (NO hand-written coordinates), then:
`drawio-ai validate <file>` → `drawio-ai render <file> -o <file>.png` (`Read`
the PNG for the vision self-check) → write the `.drawio` to an **absolute path
under the user's project** (never the Kit, never `cwd`).

## Domain notes

Logical layers: medallion architecture `Bronze (raw) → Silver (cleaned) → Gold
(business-ready)`. Deployment split: the Databricks **control plane** is managed
by Databricks (no diagram representation needed); the **data plane** (compute)
lives in the customer's cloud account via PrivateLink or VNet injection — show
it nested inside the customer's VPC/cloud boundary. Unity Catalog governs
metadata across workspaces.

## Self-check (before delivering)
- [ ] Built with the layout engine — no hand-written coordinates.
- [ ] `drawio-ai validate` → ok, no warnings, no advice.
- [ ] Every icon came from `drawio-ai search` (category colors intact).
- [ ] `drawio-ai render` vision self-check passed.
- [ ] Output written under the user's project, not the Kit.
